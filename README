Formatter-FOAFKnows-vCard version 0.1
=====================================

This module takes a vCard string parses it using L<Text::vCard> and
attempts to make C<foaf:knows> records from it. It's scope is limited
to that, it is not intended to be a full vCard to RDF conversion
module, it just wants to make reasonable knows records of your
contacts.

It is also conservative in what it outputs. If a vCard contains a
"CONFIDENTIAL" class, it will write nothing, and unless a there is a
"PUBLIC" class, it will only output the SHA1-hashed mailbox, a nick if
it exists and a homepage if it exists. A discussion of these issues
will appear in this module later.

The module also contains a script foafvcard.pl. Not very useful right
now, you will have to edit it, but it is the idea that in future
versions, it can be run from the command line to use the module to
produce useful files directly.

More information will appear here later.
